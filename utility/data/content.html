  Good web design has visual weight, is optimized for various devices, and has
  content that is prioritized for the medium. The most important elements of a
  web page should have more visual weight to “naturally attract” a visitor’s
  attention.
</p>

  Contents A good website should be easy to navigate Creating visual rhythms in
  your layouts Elements that can help website visual composition Diving into UX
  and UI design Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify Breaking
  down the barriers Optimization for various types of devices and resolutions
  plays a fundamental role in modern website design. Web page layouts should be
  genuinely responsive and not rely on any fixed-size elements. Web designers
  using fluid grids and flexible images will guarantee that a web page will
  render well on a variety of devices, windows, and screen sizes.

<p>
  Most users search for something interesting (or useful) and clickable; as soon
  as some promising candidates are found, users click. If the new page doesn’t
  meet users’ expectations, the back button is clicked and the search process is
  continued.
</p>

<h4>A good website should be easy to navigate</h4>

<p>
  Not all websites are made equal. Some websites are simple, logical, and easy
  to use. Others are a messy hodgepodge of pages and links.

    <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank"> Leading Lines </a>
  </li>
  <li>Balance Out Your Elements</li>
  <li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other</strong></li>
  <li>
    Be clear about your <strong>“focal points”</strong> and where you place them
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance.
  An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design
  projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is
  not a desirable trait.

    UX design refers to the term “user experience design”, while UI stands for
    “user interface design”. Both elements are crucial to a product and work
    closely together. But despite their relationship, the roles themselves are
    quite different.

<h3>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</h3>

<p>
  Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons,
  to make them easy to identify. For example, “change the appearance of links”
  on mouse hover, “keyboard focus”, and “touch-screen activation”.

  Design is not the end-all solution to all of the worlds problems — but with
  the right thinking and application, it can definitely be a good beginning to
  start tackling them.
